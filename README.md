# BlogBoost

BlogBoost is a dynamic and interactive blogging platform that allows users to read blogs, like them, and add comments. It offers an engaging user experience with real-time like counts and comment submissions. Users can view blogs, comment on them, and enjoy a "celebration" effect when they like a post.

## Features
- **Read Blogs**: View blog posts with content, title, and description.
- **Like Button**: Users can like a blog post. The heart icon changes color, and the like count updates dynamically.
- **Comment System**: Users can add comments on blog posts, with their comments stored in local storage and associated with the blog post.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Celebration Effect**: When a blog is liked, a smooth animation effect is shown to indicate the like action.

## Demo

You can see the live version of BlogBoost (if available) here: [BlogBoost Live](#)

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The frontend is built using React to manage the UI and state of the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the UI components with a responsive and modern design.
- **LocalStorage**: Used to store comments and like counts persistently.
- **Lucide React**: For rendering icons (like the heart icon for likes).
